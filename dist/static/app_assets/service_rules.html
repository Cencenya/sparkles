Phone numbers are used to provide our Services to you and other TMMTMM users. You may optionally add other information to your account, such as a profile name and profile picture.</p><h2>Messages</h2><p>TMMTMM cannot decrypt or otherwise access the content of your messages or calls. TMMTMM queues encrypted messages on its servers for delivery to devices that are temporarily offline (e.g. a phone whose battery has died).</p><p>Additional technical information is stored on our servers, including randomly generated authentication tokens, keys, push tokens, and other material that is necessary to establish calls and transmit messages.</p><h2>Contacts</h2><p>TMMTMM can optionally discover which contacts in your address book are TMMTMM users, using a service designed to protect the privacy of your contacts. Information from the contacts on your device may be cryptographically hashed and transmitted to the server in order to determine which of your contacts are registered.</p><h2>User Support</h2><p>If you contact TMMTMM User Support, any personal data you may share with us is kept only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your case.</p><h2>Managing your information</h2><p>You can manage your personal information in TMMTMMâ€™s application Settings. For example, you can update your profile information.</p><h2>Information we may share</h2><h3>Third Parties</h3><p>We work with third parties to provide some of our Services. For example, our Third-Party Providers send a verification code to your phone number when you register for our Services. These providers are bound by their Privacy Policies to safeguard that information. If you use other Third-Party Services like YouTube, Spotify, Giphy, etc. in connection with our Services, their Terms and Privacy Policies govern your use of those services.</p><h3>Other instances where TMMTMM may need to share your data</h3><ul><li>To meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li><li>To enforce applicable Terms, including investigation of potential violations.</li><li>To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li><li>To protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Signal, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li></ul><h1>Terms</h1><p>By singing up for TMMTMM, you agree not to:</p><ul><li>use our service to send spam or scam users.</li><li>promote violence on publicly viewable TMMTMM groups.</li><li>post pronograhic content on publicly viewable TMMTMM groups.</li></ul><p>We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service later.</p></body></html>
